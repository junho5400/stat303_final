Second, I pulled American Community Survey (ACS) 2023 5-year estimates from the U.S. Census using the Python census package. I used total population, white (non-Hispanic) population, and median household income at the census block-group level so I could calculate percent people of color and compare income. Finally, I used the 2023 TIGER/Line block-group shapefiles from the Census Bureau, filtered to Cook County, to get the geographic boundaries needed for spatial joins between Divvy stations and demographic data.\n",

    "In the Divvy trip data, rides where the end time occurred before the start time were removed, since these represent incorrect or incomplete Divvy trips. Rows with missing latitude or longitude were dropped because they prevent spatial mapping when we overlay this data onto the community boundary areas. Columns ‘started_at’ and ‘ended_at’ columns were converted into DateTime objects, and additional variables of ‘ride_minutes’, ‘date’, ‘hour’, and ‘day_of_week’ were added for potential temporal analysis.

    "To understand how Divvy access relates to neighborhood characteristics, I started by comparing block groups with and without stations. I used boxplots to compare median income and percent people of color for areas that have at least one station versus those that have none, and I ran t-tests to see whether the differences in means were statistically meaningful. I then refined this by looking at station density, grouping block groups into four bins (0, 1, 2–3, and 4+ stations) and making boxplots of income and percent people of color across these bins. A simple summary table showed that income generally increases, and the share of people of color decreases, as the number of stations rises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I treated the number of stations as a numeric variable and used scatterplots with regression lines to examine how station counts relate to median income and percent people of color. I calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to quantify these relationships. Finally, I created choropleth maps of percent people of color and median income across block groups and overlaid Divvy station locations. These maps showed visually that stations are concentrated in and around the Loop and the North Side, which tend to be higher-income and less heavily composed of people of color than many South and West Side areas.\n",

    "Divvy station accessibility relate across Chicago’s community areas, and whether neighborhoods with higher physical inactivity experience different crash rates or different levels of access to bike-share infrastructure. To analyze across datasets, we needed to transform the Divvy ride coordinates and the Chicago community boundaries into a consistent coordinate reference system, which was EPSG:3435. Upon transforming these, our key metrics, which were Divvy station counts in each community area and the ride volume, could be calculated at the community level to align with existing inactivity rates and traffic crash metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "After spatially joining the data into one frame, we aggregated Divvy ride activity by community area. The number of rides beginning in each neighborhood and the number of Divvy stations located there were chosen as the ride count reflects actual usage of the Divvy bike stations, and the station count reflects the infrastructure access. These variables help explain Divvy station access, and by aggregating the activity by community area, we can compare community areas based on physical inactivity, traffic crashes, and Divvy station infrastructure. \n",

    "Below are the log-transformed plots. Because Divvy station counts and the ride totals were both heavily skewed right, it was necessary to log transform them for proper analysis.\n",

    "![Log transformed plots](./images/chisa/logtransformed.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we visualized each of the variables’ pairwise relationships. The scatterplots below contain the relationships between physical inactivity and traffic crashes, physical inactivity and Divvy station counts, and Divvy station counts and traffic crashes. These scatterplots let us see whether communities with higher inactivity tended to have fewer Divvy stations, which may imply limited access may be related to inactivity, or different crash patterns, which may imply that mobility environments differ between community areas. Having these scatterplots highlight the direction, strength, and form of relationships, including nonlinear trends or the influence of outliers.\n",

Physical Inactivity vs. Divvy Station Count has a correlation of -0.46, which indicates a moderate negative relationship between the variables.

    "Neighborhoods with higher Divvy station volume and ridership, are clustered mainly in the areas with higher traffic crash counts, which confirms the earlier finding that community areas with high Divvy station volume also tend to be high-activity, high-traffic zones. Areas with high physical inactivity and low Divvy access are consistent with the moderate negative correlation between inactivity and station count. These visualizations support that there may be spatial divides in Chicago, where central and transit-rich neighborhoods have higher physical activity and Divvy station access. "

    "### Q1: Access and Equity\n",
    "The main challenges in this project were geospatial and cleaning-related. At first, my spatial joins failed because the Divvy stations and block-group polygons were stored in different coordinate systems, so I had to learn how to reproject everything consistently and verify that the joins were working. I also had to deal with odd ACS income values and a very skewed income distribution, which led me to explore and apply the IQR rule for outlier removal. Working through these issues taught me how sensitive geospatial analysis is to careful preprocessing, and how small choices in cleaning and merging can change the story the data tells. If I repeated the project, I would bring in ridership data sooner so I could study both where stations are and how they are actually being used.\n",

This pattern appears consistently in summaries by station presence, in station-density bins, in correlations with station counts, and on city maps.

Neighborhoods with low station density, low ridership, and higher inactivity rates should be focused on to improve their Divvy station placement across the city. Furthermore, places with higher rates of traffic crashes should have stricter traffic regulations implemented, or infrastructure that supports the higher volume of Divvy access, such as dedicated bike lanes. However, the data captured only covers the year of 2024, and may not reflect current Divvy trends. Traffic crashes are also aggregated across all severities as well, giving minor and more severe traffic crashes equal weight. An analysis with updated data and more detailed data about traffic crashes and Divvy station access should be performed before taking any major action. "

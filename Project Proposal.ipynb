    "Ethan: I will use two main data sources. First, I will pull the locations of Divvy bike stations from the City of Chicago’s open data portal (Divvy Bicycle Stations dataset: available via the Chicago Data Portal), which provides station IDs, names, and latitude/longitude coordinates; this will let me identify which census units have zero, one, or multiple Divvy stations. Second, I will use demographic and socioeconomic data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates, accessed through data.census.gov, to obtain measures such as racial composition, median household income, poverty rates, and education levels for census tracts or block groups in Chicago. By spatially joining the Divvy station locations to the ACS geography and merging in these variables, I can compare the racial and socioeconomic makeup of areas with different levels of Divvy access and evaluate how equitable the distribution of stations is across the city.\n",

    "Chisa: I'm planning to use 3 datasets. The first one I'd like to use is [Chicago Health Atlas](https://chicagohealthatlas.org/indicators/HCSPAP?topic=adult-physical-inactivity-rate) to find the traffic crashes, adult physical inactivity counts, and adult physical inactivity rates by neighborhood. The next one I'd like to use is [Divvy Bikes](https://divvybikes.com/system-data) to get the location of Divvy stops using the latitude and longtitude. Finaly, I'd like to use this [City of Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Community-Areas-Map/cauq-8yn6) dataset to help map latitude-longitude coordinates to a neighborhood and find the overall density of Divvy stations in each neighborhood."

    "Ethan: I will use two main data sources. First, I will pull the locations of Divvy bike stations from the City of Chicago’s open data portal (Divvy Bicycle Stations dataset: available via the Chicago Data Portal), which provides station IDs, names, and latitude/longitude coordinates; this will let me identify which census units have zero, one, or multiple Divvy stations. Second, I will use demographic and socioeconomic data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates, accessed through data.census.gov, to obtain measures such as racial composition, median household income, poverty rates, and education levels for census tracts or block groups in Chicago. By spatially joining the Divvy station locations to the ACS geography and merging in these variables, I can compare the racial and socioeconomic makeup of areas with different levels of Divvy access and evaluate how equitable the distribution of stations is across the city.\n",

    "Chisa: I'm planning to use 3 datasets. The first one I'd like to use is [Chicago Health Atlas](https://chicagohealthatlas.org/indicators/HCSPAP?topic=adult-physical-inactivity-rate) to find the traffic crashes, adult physical inactivity counts, and adult physical inactivity rates by neighborhood. The next one I'd like to use is [Divvy Bikes](https://divvybikes.com/system-data) to get the location of Divvy stops using the latitude and longtitude. Finaly, I'd like to use this [City of Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Community-Areas-Map/cauq-8yn6) dataset to help map latitude-longitude coordinates to a neighborhood and find the overall density of Divvy stations in each neighborhood.\n",

    "Eduardo: I will be using three main data sources. Divvy Trip Data: https://divvybikes.com/system-data. Census Data: https://data.census.gov/. Chicago Data Portal: https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=most_accessed&pageSize=20&page=1. Divvy Trip Data allows direct analysis of ride usage, segmenting by rider type, time, and station. Census Data makes it possible to connect ride patterns to local demographic attributes, revealing how factors like income, age, or ethnicity may correlate with ridership and type. Chicago Data Portal supports spatial mapping, letting you frame Divvy station locations in relation to neighborhood features and infrastructure, improving the robustness of interpretation on demographic usage effects.\n",

    "Junho: I will be using mainly 4 datasets. First, I will use [Divvy Trip Data](https://divvybikes.com/system-data), which provides ride-level information including timestamps, station locations, and rider type from 2013 to present; this data will allow me to calculate usage rates across different expansion phases. Second, I will use Divvy Bicycle Stations data from the [City of Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Divvy-Bicycle-Stations-Map/bk89-9dk7), which includes station locations with coordinates and installation dates, enabling me to identify when stations were added to different neighborhoods and define distinct expansion phases. Third, I will use [U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates](https://data.census.gov) to obtain racial composition and socioeconomic data for Chicago's community areas across multiple years (e.g., 2009-2013, 2014-2018, 2019-2023). Finally, I will use [Census Tract Boundaries for Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Census-Tracts-2010/5jrd-6zik) to spatially map stations and rides to census tracts.

    "This project will provide Equiticity, Divvy operators, and city planners with insights to promote equity in Chicago's bike-share system. By analyzing station distribution, ridership evolution, health outcomes, and user behavior across demographic groups, we will identify which communities are underserved and reveal how past expansion efforts impacted usage disparities. These findings will enable data-driven decisions about future station placements, infrastructure investments, and policies that prioritize mobility justice. Our comprehensive analysis supports Equiticity's mission to operationalize racial equity in transportation and provides evidence for creating a more accessible bike-share network for all Chicago residents."

    "### Q1: Access and Equity\n",
    "How fairly are Divvy stations spread across Chicago? I look at where stations are located, whether some neighborhoods have many more stations than others, and whether areas with more stations tend to be richer or have more white residents than areas with few or no stations. In other words, I am asking whether access to Divvy is evenly shared across the city, or whether it is concentrated in higher-income, mostly white neighborhoods.\n",

    "### Q3: Membership & Frequency\n",
    "The question asks how people who buy a yearly Divvy membership use the bikes differently from people who pay per ride or by day. It looks at how often they ride, how long their rides last, what time of day they ride, and which parts of Chicago they ride in. It also asks whether these differences line up with who lives in each area, such as income levels and racial or ethnic makeup based on census data.\n",

    "I used the Divvy Bicycle Stations dataset from the Chicago Data Portal, which lists each station’s ID, name, status, and latitude/longitude and allowed me to map active stations across the city [1]. Second, I pulled American Community Survey (ACS) 2023 5-year estimates from the U.S. Census using the Python census package. I used total population, white (non-Hispanic) population, and median household income at the census block-group level so I could calculate percent people of color and compare income [5]. Finally, I used the 2023 TIGER/Line block-group shapefiles from the Census Bureau, filtered to Cook County, to get the geographic boundaries needed for spatial joins between Divvy stations and demographic data [6].\n",

    "There were a few potentially incorrect or problematic values that required cleaning. In the ACS data, median income sometimes appeared as large negative numbers, which the Census uses as flags for missing or unreliable estimates, so I converted `med_income` to numeric and set any negative values to missing. I also found that the income distribution was highly skewed, so I applied the standard IQR rule to drop extreme outliers before computing group means and medians. On the Divvy side, I restricted the station dataset to rows whose status was “In Service” and converted latitude and longitude into geometries so that only active stations with valid locations were used.\n",

    "The analysis also required several additional preparation steps before it was ready to use. I constructed a census `GEOID` for each block group and merged the ACS attributes with the 2023 TIGER/Line block-group shapefiles, filtered to Cook County. I reprojected both the block-group polygons and the Divvy station points into the same projected coordinate system to allow a correct spatial join. Using that join, I assigned each Divvy station to the block group it falls inside and then aggregated to obtain the number of stations per block group and a binary indicator of whether a block group has at least one station. Finally, I created the station-density categories (0, 1, 2–3, 4+ stations) and computed percent people of color and percent white non-Hispanic, which together formed the cleaned dataset used for all plots and statistical comparisons.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Divvy Trip Data Standardization:**  \n",
    "The Divvy trip datasets spanning 2013-2025 contained significant format variations across years. Column names changed multiple times: early years (2013-2016) used `starttime`, `from_station_*`, and `usertype`, while later years (2020+) switched to `started_at`, `start_station_*`, and `member_casual`. The 2019 dataset used entirely different naming conventions with prefixes like `'01 - Rental Details Rental ID'`. A standardization function was created to extract only essential columns (year, ride_id, station IDs/names, user_type) and unify them across all years. Q2 data (April-June) was filtered from full-year or Q1Q2 files where necessary. The 2013 dataset was excluded due to insufficient Q2 rides (only 4,005 rides).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Station Coordinate Mapping:**  \n",
    "The Divvy station file (`Divvy_Bicycle_Stations_20251207.csv`) contained 1,149 current stations but did not cover all historical stations from trip data. Station name matching was performed to add coordinates, achieving 75-80% ride coverage across years. Rides without matching stations were removed to ensure all records had valid geographic coordinates, resulting in 12,071,787 rides (80% of original 15,078,402 rides).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial Mapping to Census Tracts:**  \n",
    "Ride coordinates were converted to Point geometries and spatially joined with 2010 Census tract boundaries using GeoPandas `sjoin` with `predicate='within'`. Of 12,071,787 rides, 12,000,613 (99.4%) successfully mapped to census tracts; 71,174 rides fell outside tract boundaries and were excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ACS Data Processing:**  \n",
    "American Community Survey 5-year estimates were used to match demographic data to ride years: 2017 ACS (2013-2017 estimates) for 2014-2017 rides, 2022 ACS (2018-2022) for 2018-2022 rides, and 2023 ACS (2019-2023) for 2023-2025 rides. Census tract GEOIDs in ACS files had a `1400000US` prefix that was removed for matching. Column names varied between ACS years, with 2017/2022 using `Percent Estimate!!` prefix while 2023 used `Percent!!`. A prefix detection function handled these variations automatically. Median household income appeared in different inflation-adjusted dollar columns across years (e.g., \"2017 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS\" vs \"2023 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS\"), requiring dynamic column detection. All percentage and income values were converted to numeric, with errors coerced to NaN.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demographic Categorization:**  \n",
    "Census tracts were categorized by race based on plurality (highest percentage among White NH, Black NH, Hispanic, Asian), labeled as \"Predominantly [Race]\". A diversity flag (`is_diverse`) was added for tracts where no group exceeded 50%. Income was binned into four categories: Low (<$50k), Medium ($50-75k), High ($75-100k), and Very High (>$100k) based on inflation-adjusted median household income.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase Assignment:**  \n",
    "Years were grouped into three expansion phases: Phase 1 (2014-2017) representing the initial system, Phase 2 (2018-2022) showing equity-focused expansion, and Phase 3 (2023-2025) reflecting recent growth. Station first-appearance years were calculated to identify which phase each station was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potentially Incorrect Values:**\n",
    "- Negative median income values in ACS data were converted to NaN\n",
    "- Rides with missing station names or coordinates were excluded\n",
    "- Census tracts with missing demographic data (4 tracts for race, 76 for income) were dropped from relevant analyses\n",
    "- Station expansion analysis removed 6 records lacking demographic matches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Preparation:**\n",
    "- Created cumulative station counts by phase for distribution analysis\n",
    "- Calculated rides per capita by merging ride counts with census tract population\n",
    "- Generated percentage change metrics comparing Phase 1 (2014-2017) to Phase 3 (2023-2025)\n",
    "- Capped percentage change values at -100% to +300% for visualization clarity\n",

    "Before the data was usable, there were some questionable values that indicated cleaning. The start and end times of a trip were in string format instead of datetime objects for easier processing so these were cast. Rows which indicated times that could not be read were dropped to prevent invalid start times and durations. Duration was cast in minutes and any trip with a duration of one minute or less (likely a rider mistake or a log-in error) as well as trips over 24 hours (trying to manually extend a trip) were dropped, too. Start and end locations were in latitude/longitude so these were cast into geometries as start and end points. Some missing values for trips without lat/long info or that were just outside community polygons meant that ~1,600 trips did not receive a start_community; these rows were kept as we explicitly note their missing community status in the summaries. For the ACS community dataset, income and race variables were provided as comma-separated strings so commas were removed and the values cast as numeric types instead. The names of the communities from ACS and spatial boundaries were cast to uppercase and spaces trimmed for accurate matching to the names produced from the spatial join from trips to community areas.\n",
    "Finally, there were some additional means of preparing the data for analysis to connect trips with neighborhoods and demographics. For example, from the start time of each trip I engineered day_of_week, hour_of_day, month, year, and whether it was a weekend so usage patterns could be compared from day-of-week/hour-to-hour. Trips start and end points were cast as GeoDataFrames which could be spatially joined to the Chicago community area polygons so each ride was assigned a start_community/end_community. Community-level census information from the ACS table (number of residents total, income brackets, race/ethnic breakdowns) was merged onto communities with the name of the community-area after naming conventions were standardized. Finally, a community-level summary table was created that contains total trips, member trips, casual trips, mean and median ride length, trips/1,000 residents, income breakdown (median income, low-income percentage), racial/ethnic breakdown (majority race/ethnicity, minority percentages), and diversity index; this is a ready dataset for further neighborhood/demographic analyses.\n",

    "In the Divvy trip data, rides where the end time occurred before the start time were removed, since these represent incorrect or incomplete Divvy trips. Rows with missing latitude or longitude were dropped because they prevent spatial mapping when we overlay this data onto the community boundary areas. Columns ‘started_at’ and ‘ended_at’ columns were converted into DateTime objects, and additional variables of ‘ride_minutes’, ‘date’, ‘hour’, and ‘day_of_week’ were added for potential temporal analysis. Finally, columns ‘start_point’ and ‘end_point’ were derived from the latitude and longitude. \n",

Non-analytical columns like the ‘layer’ column were also removed.\n",

    "In the community boundary data, columns were renamed for better interpretation and clarity. The column ‘community_area_name’ was standardized to match the health dataset. Geometry values, which originally were WKT strings, were converted into shapely geometry objects.

Finally, centroid latitude and longitude values were computed for later mapping and visualization.   \n",
    "\n",
    "All spatial data, such as Divvy-ride coordinates and community boundary polygons, were transformed into the same CRS (EPSG:3435) to standardize them for spatial operations. Next, a spatial join was used to assign each Divvy ride to the community area where the ride started. \n",
    "After spatially aligning the rides to each community area, features were aggregated at the community-area level. This included computing Divvy station counts per community area and calculating the number of rides that started in each community area. \n",
    "The three datasets were then merged into one unified dataframe (community_stats) containing all variables needed for mapping and modeling.\n",
    "Finally, variables such as Divvy station counts and total ride counts were heavily right-skewed. We applied log transformations to make visualizations and relationships easier to interpret. These transformations helped stabilize variance and improve the interpretability of scatterplots and comparisons across community areas.\n"

    "\n",
    "To understand how Divvy's expansion affected equity across Chicago neighborhoods, I analyzed station distribution and ridership patterns across three distinct phases: Phase 1 (2014-2017) representing the initial system, Phase 2 (2018-2022) capturing equity-focused expansion, and Phase 3 (2023-2025) reflecting recent growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Station Distribution Analysis:**  \n",
    "I first examined how station placement evolved across demographic groups. Using stacked bar charts, I visualized the percentage distribution of stations by race category at the end of each phase (cumulative) and compared this with the distribution of newly added stations in Phases 2 and 3 (incremental). Census tracts were categorized by plurality race (Predominantly White, Black, Hispanic, or Asian) based on 2017, 2022, and 2023 ACS data matched to their respective time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Station Distribution Charts](images/junho/station_distribution.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis revealed that Phase 1 was heavily concentrated in Predominantly White areas (57.9% of stations), but expansion became progressively more equitable. By Phase 3, new stations were distributed nearly equally: 33.2% in Hispanic areas, 32.8% in White areas, and 31.9% in Black areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial Station Expansion:**  \n",
    "To visualize geographic patterns, I created three choropleth maps showing census tracts colored by race category with station locations overlaid as points. Each map represents cumulative stations at the end of each phase, allowing visual tracking of how the system expanded from the downtown core and North Side into previously underserved South and West Side neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Expansion Maps](images/junho/expansion_maps.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ridership Temporal Trends:**  \n",
    "Next, I analyzed ridership patterns over time using dual line charts. The left chart shows total rides by race category from 2014-2025, revealing that Predominantly White areas consistently accounted for 85-92% of all rides despite representing only ~47% of stations by Phase 3. The right chart displays per capita ridership (rides per person per year), which provides a normalized view accounting for population differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Ridership Trends](images/junho/ridership_trends.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ridership Volume with Demographic Context:**  \n",
    "To visualize the relationship between ridership patterns and neighborhood demographics, I created maps showing census tracts colored by race category with ridership volume overlaid as red circles scaled by ride counts. These maps demonstrate the stark spatial inequality: large circles (high ridership) cluster almost exclusively in Predominantly White (blue) North Side areas, while Predominantly Black (orange) and Hispanic (light blue) South and West Side neighborhoods show minimal ridership despite receiving stations in later phases.\n",

This visualization made the equity gap explicit: while Predominantly White areas showed slight growth from Phase 1 to Phase 3 (1.29 → 1.41 rides per capita), Black areas declined from 0.20 to 0.11, and Hispanic areas dropped from 0.17 to 0.07.\n",

A growth map colored tracts on a red-yellow-green scale representing percentage change from Phase 1 to Phase 3. Green areas (growth) clustered primarily in already well-served North Side neighborhoods, while many South and West Side tracts showed stagnation or decline despite receiving new stations.\n",

    "### Analysis 3: Membership & Frequency\n",
    "*By Eduardo Sourd*\n",
    "The first exploratory analysis tested whether ride lengths are different between an annual member versus a casual rider. The cleaned trip data was explored first by determining length in minutes per trip. Then, a kernel density plot was overlaid with a curve for members and casuals to see if there's any difference between the two. This is because this will show an entirety of the population and not just the averages, shapes for general distributions were similar. They are both right skewed, and where members are slightly centroids a bit more around shorter rides, casuals take a bit more with a heavier tail on the longer ride side. This is how density plots work as a common means of assessing difference in groups for continuous variables and it's easy to justify how often shorter trips/longer trips occur based on what is observed.\n",
    "![Ride length density plot](images/eduardo/distribution-of-ride-lengths-by-rider-type.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second exploratory analysis tested when Divvy bikes tend to be used by riders throughout the day and week. The start_date variable was used to create hour_of_day and day_of_week. Grouping trips by hour and rider type showed a count to create a line plot of trips per hour for members and casuals. This showed an increase of member rides at 8am and 5pm with a peak in casuals at 12pm and then a downward trend leaning towards peak time. This makes sense with casuals being more focused on recreation as that's when recreational options are open whereas members seem to have more of a commuting strategy related to their work lives. However, to assess hours and weekdays patterns together, trips were aggregated by hour_of_day and day_of_week per rider type, pivoted into matrices to see two heatmaps next to each other. This determined that member ridership is confined to weekdays commuting hours while casual activity is more afternoon and weekend-based—this is a stronger indicator of recreation as if they were consistently using it for transportation it would be on the weekends as well. Line plots and heatmaps are compact representations of such uses that show clear patterns over time. In addition, a lot of the Divvy and bike-share analyses utilize similar visualizations.\n",

    "The third analysis compared where people use community bikes from their destination with where community demographic patterns suggest, testing whether use is higher in certain neighborhoods. Starting polygons were converted to spatial points and joined to Chicago community area polygons so that each trip was assigned a starting community; trip data were aggregated to the community level to determine total number of trips, member share, number of trips per 1,000 residents, income bracket counts, race counts, and derived diversity metrics (ACS 5‑year data). These community‑level attributes were applied to generate scatter plots where the y-axis represents member share and the x-axis, which includes the percentage of residents in the highest income bracket, percentage Asian, trips per 1,000 residents, and an income diversity index (derived from ACS Data), and the bubble size corresponding to total trips. Simple linear trend lines and trendline equation statistics were applied to summarize an r value of strength and direction of these associations. This method directly answers whether higher income, more Asian, or more frequent communities have a higher share of the member riders since it's clear that's the case in some areas but not others. Additionally, scatter plots with fitted lines represent a common assumption when trying to assess associations.\n",

    "Divvy station accessibility relate across Chicago’s community areas, and whether neighborhoods with higher physical inactivity experience different crash rates or different levels of access to bike-share infrastructure. To analyze across datasets, we needed to transform the Divvy ride coordinates and the Chicago community boundaries into a consistent coordinate reference system, which was EPSG:3435. Upon transforming these, our key metrics, which were Divvy station counts in each community area and the ride volume, could be calculated at the community level to align with existing inactivity rates and traffic crash metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "After spatially joining the data into one frame, we aggregated Divvy ride activity by community area. The number of rides beginning in each neighborhood and the number of Divvy stations located there were chosen as the ride count reflects actual usage of the Divvy bike stations, and the station count reflects the infrastructure access. These variables help explain Divvy station access, and by aggregating the activity by community area, we can compare community areas based on physical inactivity, traffic crashes, and Divvy station infrastructure. \n",

The scatterplots below contain the relationships between physical inactivity and traffic crashes, physical inactivity and Divvy station counts, and Divvy station counts and traffic crashes. These scatterplots let us see whether communities with higher inactivity tended to have fewer Divvy stations, which may imply limited access may be related to inactivity, or different crash patterns, which may imply that mobility environments differ between community areas.

At first, my spatial joins failed because the Divvy stations and block-group polygons were stored in different coordinate systems, so I had to learn how to reproject everything consistently and verify that the joins were working. I also had to deal with odd ACS income values and a very skewed income distribution, which led me to explore and apply the IQR rule for outlier removal. Working through these issues taught me how sensitive geospatial analysis is to careful preprocessing, and how small choices in cleaning and merging can change the story the data tells.

This pattern appears consistently in summaries by station presence, in station-density bins, in correlations with station counts, and on city maps.

Most interestingly, the final visualizations revealed similar patterns. Members fill a majority of weekday rush hours and are denser in higher income, higher use communities while casual users are more around leisure hours and neighborhoods. Ultimately, this assignment was an insightful experience into the from scratch pipeline of taking disparate files to spatially joined and community level assessments, and how even simple descriptive analytics can highlight significant inequities and prospects in a real life transit system.\n",

Furthermore, community areas with higher Divvy access experience higher counts of traffic crashes, which reflects the Divvy stations’ location of being in denser or more active parts of the city. The patterns observed were consistent across scatter plots, correlations, and choropleth maps. This highlights a spatial divide, where more central parts of the city have stronger Divvy infrastructure and higher mobility, while areas outside of these tend to face higher inactivity levels and less access to Divvy infrastructure. \n"

    "**Limitations:** This analysis uses ACS demographic snapshots that may not capture rapid neighborhood change. Census tract racial classifications shifted between 2017 and 2023, complicating longitudinal comparisons. Additionally, 20% of historical rides were excluded due to missing station data. Stakeholders should repeat this analysis with 2024-2025 data and conduct qualitative research (surveys, focus groups) to validate barriers like affordability and safety concerns.\n",

    "### Q3: Membership & Frequency\n",
    "These proposals are intended for the Divvy operations and marketing team. Since members make up the majority of ridership during weekday commutes and are heavily clustered in high-income, high-usage areas, Divvy should use communities with significant usage but limited member share for targeted membership drives/employer partnerships to convert these casual riders into members. Simultaneously, rebalancing and capacity considerations should emphasize commuter peaks for member-heavy regions and afternoon/weekend demand for touristy areas. Since these findings are based on a single month's worth of data and correlation assessment, they're good for piloting and subsequent experimentation but not sweeping, large, irreversible changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Safety and Mobility\n",
    "This is recommended for a City of Chicago transportation planner, who may be focusing on where to add new Divvy stations and how to reduce physical inactivity rates. The city should expand Divvy station coverage in community areas with high physical inactivity and limited Divvy access. Neighborhoods with low station density, low ridership, and higher inactivity rates should be focused on to improve their Divvy station placement across the city. Furthermore, places with higher rates of traffic crashes should have stricter traffic regulations implemented, or infrastructure that supports the higher volume of Divvy access, such as dedicated bike lanes. However, the data captured only covers the year of 2024, and may not reflect current Divvy trends. Traffic crashes are also aggregated across all severities as well, giving minor and more severe traffic crashes equal weight. An analysis with updated data and more detailed data about traffic crashes and Divvy station access should be performed before taking any major action. "
